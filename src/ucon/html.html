<p>Hi Zach,</p>
<p>You can also view your complete schedule on Tabletop.Events: https://tabletop.events/conventions/u-con-2025/schedule/my/hosting</p>
<p>A more detailed follow-up email will be coming soon. For now, I wanted to get this out quickly so you can see your adventures and let me know if anything looks off.</p>
<p>Here is your schedule:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><strong>Slot 3</strong> (<a href="https://tabletop.events/conventions/u-con-2025/schedule/"><strong>Fri Evening 8:00 PM</strong></a>) – Iron Cook (PS-DC-IC)</li>

<p><strong>Special Notes</strong>: - <strong>Epic (Song of Spears)</strong>: We scheduled more DMs than we need. Please prep at least the tier you’ve been assigned to, but if possible, prep both in case of emergency. If we have more DMs than needed, you’ll have the option to play instead.</p>

<ul class="incremental">
<li><strong>Charity rerolls</strong>: We will be raising money for charity again this year. Players can buy tickets at the AL HQ or pay online. If they want to just put a dollar on the table, that’s also fine. Let’s see how much we can raise, some players really get into the spirit of that! If they spend $5 or more over the course of the convention, we have typically gotten a special reward cert to give out. Let’s hope we get one this year too.</li>
<li><strong>DM Appreciation Certs</strong>: We will have appreciation certs for the DMs most likely. I haven’t gotten details about those yet, but make sure to check in with me at the convention.</li>
<li><strong>Plans Change</strong>: If something should happen and things change, please let me know as soon as possible. The longer I have to account for it, the better the chances are that I can figure it out. :)</li>
<li><strong>Safety &amp; Table Culture</strong>: Please open your tables with a quick check-in and mention of safety tools — even a short reminder sets the right tone.</li>
<li><strong>AL HQ</strong>: If you or your players need anything, AL HQ is the place to go. Even if I’m not there, check in and we’ll get it sorted.</li>
<li><strong>Contact</strong>: Feel free to reach out to me with this email, or via Discord as “hoshisabi” (or you can check into my discord at https://discord.gg/4x7p2NPs4Q).</li>
